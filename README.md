The Program has two java classes:
1- MainLongestSequence.java
  * Read the input from user(n).
  *Create object of CalculateSequence class 
  *Print out the Longest sequence
2- CalculateSequence.java
  * Generate List<Integer> from random numbers.
  * Calculate the Longest Sequnce and return the subList
